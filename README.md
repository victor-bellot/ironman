# End-of-Study Project at CEA-LIST

This internship is subject to an industrial confidentiality agreement (my supervisor is keen on the possibility of patenting the work done).

As such, I am not able to share my internship report. Similarly, the code for the developed method is not available in this repository.

## Work Completed

The goal of this internship was to design a method for generating multi-finger grasps of partially perceived objects (perception from a depth camera viewpoint).

After studying robotic grasping and identifying the most promising approaches along with their limitations, we propose the IronMan method 
(see the presentation slides for more information).
